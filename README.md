This is a powershell script that'll grab all the AD servers for the domain your computer is on. It'll then set the CVE 2020-1350 DNS workaround on those servers and restart DNS.

NOTE!! it will restart DNS so you might need a maintenance window to run it. This workaround does not mean that you can avoid patching your servers but it should help buy you some time especially if you have windows servers on the internet.
